      "If These Apps Are Installed On Your Phone, You Can ‘Easily’ Be Hacked",
    content:
      "When iPhone users claim their devices are more secure than Android alternatives, it’s security reports such as the latest from Check Point they have in mind. The cyber firm has suddenly warned that “countless Android apps” are vulnerable to a security threat that should have been patched six months ago, “jeopardizing hundreds of millions of users.” These are apps almost guaranteed to be on your phone right now. \n Yet again the issue relates to a software library buried within multiple apps—ironically, though, this library was developed by Google itself as a shortcut for apps to interface with its Play Store. The “ highly dangerous ” was reported in detail back in August—a vulnerability in thousands of apps that would enable hackers to “steal users’ login details, passwords, and financial details, and read their mail.” \n Such an attack requires fairly simple malware to be planted on your phone—think of all those rogue email attachments, texted links or viral images. That malware then attacks one of the popular apps carrying the vulnerability, piggybacking on that genuine app’s permissions to access data on your phone. As such, the new malware doesn’t need to ask you for new permissions, risking detection. \nAccording to Check Point researcher Aviran Hazum, the threat is “very serious and easy to exploit.” It hasn’t been caught in the wild as yet, but given this latest publicity, attackers will now be aware of the problem which makes it much worse. A proof of concept, which attacked Google Chrome before it was patched, “used a Dropbox cookie (stored within Google Chrome) to steal files from the cloud storage platform.” \nGoogle patched the flaw in its Play Core Library way back in April, but a huge number of apps have not bothered to update the library within their own software. “During the month of September,” Check Point says, “13% of Google Play applications we analyzed used this library, and 8% of those apps had a vulnerable version.” \nSo, should users be worried? Yes, according to Hazum. “Users should  be worried about the data stored inside or accessible to applications. The malicious payload will have the same access as the hosting application. For example, injecting code into a messenger to steal all messages, or send messages on the user’s behalf. Or if a banking app is vulnerable, the attacker can steal credentials and even 2FA codes.” \nCheck Point also warns that the vulnerability can be used to “inject code into enterprise applications to gain access to corporate resources or into social media applications to spy on the victim and use location access to track the device.” As ever, a vulnerability with a popular app installed on tens of millions of devices provides a large attack surface for a targeted campaign. This becomes a soft entry point to steal credentials for a corporate network, for example, or to track persons of interest. \nIf you need convincing as to the severity of this, then let’s look at some of the apps that have just recently patched this vulnerability. \nBooking.com told me “we can confirm we have already addressed this vulnerability with a patch to our Android app on November 11.” And Cisco confirmed that “on December 1, [we] published software updates for the Cisco WebEx Teams mobile app for Android that include fixed versions of the Google Play Core Library that contains the security vulnerability.” \nGrindr told me that “we are grateful for the Check Point researcher who brought the vulnerability to our attention today. Our team quickly responded, and we have already issued a hotfix… We will continue to enhance our practices to proactively address these and similar concerns as we continue our commitment to our users.” And OkCupid confirmed “we were notified by Check Point earlier this week and have already released the fix. We’re grateful to partners like Check Point who together with OkCupid, put the safety and privacy of our users first.” \nThe issue is widespread. Check Point also lists Viber, Yango Pro and even Microsoft Edge among those apps it tested and says it found to be vulnerable, none of which responded to requests for comment before publishing. Moovit, which was also named, confirmed after publication that it had issued a fix. But to single any out would be misleading—these are just the ones Check Point “randomly” happened to test and name. One can assume those apps have patched or will soon patch the problem—it just requires the updated Google library. It’s the “countless” other apps that haven’t been tested by Check Point and so haven’t been notified that is the real issue here. \nOn one level, Google can’t do much about this. It’s for developers to manage the security of their apps. But, in truth, Google could  mandate the fix and test apps in its Play Store to ensure they are running the updated library. But Android is much more fragmented and less well policed than iOS—that’s why those iPhone users feel better protected. As Forbes  cybersecurity contributor Davey Winder said on his move from Android to iPhone , “four words explain it—security, privacy, fractured, ecosystem… I've been growing increasingly unhappy when it comes to security updates.” \nThe unhappy  situation here is that those “hundreds of millions” of users can’t know which apps have been patched and which have not. And so advising users to update or delete apps is impossible. Instead, the only advice is to be very careful with the apps you install on your phone to avoid the risk that of allowing malware onto the phone that can target the permissions given to a popular app to steal your data. \nThat means no third-party app stores, no clicking indiscriminately on emailed or texted links, no saving  images or videos onto your phone from social media sites or messengers unless  you can be fairly sure that they were created  by a trusted sender. You can also look to install an antivirus program onto your device, albeit make sure it’s from a reputable developer if you do, and that means a mainstream, paid for app. ",

      "Apple Celebrates The International Day Of Persons With Disabilities With Accessibility Site Redesign, More",
    content:
      "Apple on Thursday marked International Day of Persons with Disabilities with a slew of accessibility-centric announcements, spanning the company’s website and social media outposts. \nFirst is a redesign of the company’s accessibility website , last refreshed in 2016 at the Touch Bar MacBook Pro unveiling. Visitors to this part of Apple’s site have long been able to learn about the assistive technologies across the company’s products. The site is divided into four sections representing the different developmental domains: vision, mobility, hearing, and cognitive. Anyone, whether they identify as disabled or not, can use the information as a resource for learning about Apple’s accessibility software. There also are helpful tips for users to get the most out of their device(s). \nNext is an update to Apple Support materials. Apple has a popular presence on Twitter and particularly YouTube , where slickly-produced videos demonstrate how to use various features of various devices. New is a collection of accessibility-oriented videos covering Magnifier, Back Tap, and Voice Control. The Voice Control piece is a how-to, produced in collaboration with the United Spinal Association , on how to take selfies with the feature, introduced in 2019 as part of iOS 13 and macOS Catalina. \nThese all join Apple’s cadre of over twenty how-to videos on the Support channel. \nLastly, Apple is showcasing the work of Jordan Nicholson on its Instagram account. Nicholson is a photographer who was born with TAR Syndrome , a rare genetic disorder characterized by the absence of the radius bone in the forearm. \nIn a short interview, Nicholson told me photography is a passion of his and Apple products help him live it. They are “the standard” for creatives, he said. In addition to an iPhone, Nicholson also uses a MacBook Pro and an iPad Pro. \n“In my experience, everything just works really well. And I love how the products all work with each other,” he said. “AirDrop is actually one of my favorite features that I use constantly. As someone who is always making tons of different kinds of files, it's super helpful being able to easily beam them from device to device.” \nNicholson said the inspiration for the photos on Apple’s Instagram is color. People with disabilities, he told me, often are not accepted by the world for their authentic self—“the real you,” as he put it. He describes his life’s mission as encouraging people to live authentically—to live “colorfully” by showing the world one’s true self. \n“I always want to encourage others to live life colorfully,” he said. “That is, living life exactly as yourself and not feeling like you have to hide who you truly are! And so for this project, I wanted to photograph the people in my life who I feel are living life in that colorful way.” \nAs a photographer, Nicholson was effusive in his praise of the recently-released iPhone 12 models. He’s had every version of the smartphone since the iconic iPhone 4 was released a decade ago, and marvels at the steady improvement in camera quality over that period. The iPhone 12 has “really amazed” in terms of image quality. He added it’s “almost hard to believe” you can take such good pictures with something that fits into your pocket—and he’s experienced in bulky, ostensibly “better” SLRs. \n“I'm a photographer with tons of big, heavy equipment, but the camera I use most is for sure my iPhone,” Nicholson said. “I think it's really cool that we've reached a point in technology where you really don't have to compromise quality for convenience. iPhones give you both!” \nFor more about Nicholson, Julie Davidow wrote a profile on him for University of Washington Magazine  that was published in September of last year.

      "TicWatch Pro 3 Review: Google’s WearOS Gets Much-Needed Improvement",
    content:
      "The year 2020 has seen Android smartwatches—or a more accurate descriptor: “smartwatches that isn’t for iPhone only”—improve across the board. Whether it’s Fitbit Sense , Samsung’s Galaxy Watch 3, or the Oppo Watch , Android users can now pick up a smartwatch that looks and works well, and perhaps most importantly—doesn’t lose too badly to the Apple Watch. \nMobvoi’s TicWatch Pro 3 continues that upward trajectory. It is one of the most responsive and fastest non-Apple Watch smartwatch I’ve ever tested, because it benefits from being the first smartwatch so far to run on Qualcomm’s new Android Wear 4100 chip, which is built on 12nm technology, significantly more powerful than the 28nm Snapdragon 3100 used in many previous Android smartwatches. \nDesign and hardware \nThe TicWatch Pro 3 is an undeniably bulky smartwatch, with a 48mm face and 12.2mm in thickness. Despite its heft—you will have to take off the watch before putting on a long sleeved jacket or shirt—the TicWatch Pro 3 is relatively light at 43g. This is thanks to its blend of stainless steel (frame) and plastic (back). \nThere’s two physical hardware buttons that are clicky and responsive. You will be using swipes to navigate through the watch mostly. The included strap is made of silicone and looks like leather, with orange stitching. Overall, the look of the TicWatch Pro 3 is fine—I find its look a bit bland or nondescript, but at least it doesn’t look offensive. It doesn’t feel premium, however, especially compared to the curvy glass of the Oppo Watch, or the stainless steel all around Fitbit Sense. \nOne of the more useful—and my favorite—feature of the TicWatch Pro 3 is it technically has two screens: a main OLED display and a secondary transparent LCD layer that displays in only shades of monochrome. The latter is always-on, so the idea is that when you need to just check the time or other simple information like date or battery level, you can just use the low-powered monochrome screen. If you really need to do “smartwatch things,” then the vibrant colorful OLED screen lights up. This helps save the battery, and the TicWatch Pro 3 gets about three days on a single charge, which is good enough—but not amazing. \nSoftware: WearOS is fixed, mostly thanks to a new chip \nBut really what makes the TicWatch Pro 3 enjoyable to use its its software, now much faster and lag-free than previous WearOS devices thanks to that Snapdragon 4100 Wear 4100 chip. \nThis is quite a statement, because WearOS has been the butt of jokes in the wearable industry for years for its poor performance, so much so that Samsung and Fitbit both built their own OS instead of relying on it. I thought Oppo did about as good a job as any in optimizing WearOS with its watch, but obviously, that watch still runs on the older Snapdragon 3100 Wear chip—which Qualcomm says is 85% slower than the 4100—so the TicWatch 3 has a built-in edge. \nNow, do I feel the TicWatch Pro 3 is 85% faster? No—these numbers given by brands are always pulled from lab tests that were built to generate these eye-opening numbers. But I can feel the TicWatch Pro 3 is noticeably snappier when launching apps or calling for Google Assistant. \nAnd Google Assistant is a key reason to use WearOS, because this is Google’s own platform, it’s integrated well, along with other Google apps and services like Google Pay, Google Maps, and others. You can even log onto Google Play store and download apps directly. The selection of apps available for WearOS watches is better than the selection available to Fitbit, Samsung or Huawei’s watches (each run a proprietary OS), but still doesn’t come close to matching the Apple Watch’s app ecosystem. \nBattery life, as mentioned, is about three days of full, real use. This is much better than the Apple Watch’s barely 24 hours on a single charge, but falls far short of the Fitbit Sense’s five-six days or Huawei’s watches, which can go two full weeks. \nCharging, unfortunately, is done via a proprietary cable. I suppose this is the case for 99% of smartwatches, but having tested Huawei’s recent Watch GT2 Pro which can be charged via the same Qi wireless chargers that we use for our phones, I have been spoiled. I am not traveling much these days, but if I were, needing to bring a specific cable just for a smartwatch is annoying. \nIn terms of fitness tracking, the TicWatch Pro 3 does a solid job. It tracks steps and heart rate with good accuracy as far as I can tell, and it can automatically detect exercises too. There are even sensors to detect stress and blood oxygen levels, but from what my testing the results are very basic and doesn’t offer much insight compared to what the Apple Watch 6 or Fitbit Sense can do. \nOverall, I enjoyed my experience with the TicWatch Pro 3, and it does indeed perform a bit better than the Oppo Watch. And for those who rely on their phone’s voice assistant often, the TicWatch Pro 3 wins the Android space by default. \nSamsung’s watches can only summon the company’s own Bixby assistant, which is universally panned. Fitbit uses Alexa (for now), which is not as intelligent and ubiquitous as Google Assistant, and other WearOS watches to date still run on the older Snapdragon 3100 chip, so Google won’t be able to respond as fast. \nHowever, I find the design a bit too bland and generic, especially considering the watch’s $299 price. But whatever the case, the TicWatch Pro 3 is one of the best performing Android smartwatches, and could become known as the watch that stops the WearOS wisecracks from tech media. ",

    title: "WristCam Is A Camera For Your Apple Watch, Built Into The Strap",
    content:
      "The first-ever camera for Apple Watch debuted today. It’s called Wristcam , it’s made by a former Apple program manager and a former GoPro engineer, and it offers both an 8-megapixel “world-facing” and a separate 2-megapixel you-facing camera, allowing you to take pictures on the run, or have a video chat with a face on your wrist. \n (Insert obligatory Dick Tracy reference here.) \n “Living with Wristcam feels a bit like having superpowers... the phone isn’t always within reach, and it's nice to have a camera handy when going out with friends, or going on a run, ride, or hike with just an Apple Watch,” Ari Roisman, CEO and co-founder of Wristcam, said in a statement. “But it’s Wristcam’s live video capabilities that are truly next level and sci-fi worthy.” \n The watch is brand new, just announced, and I’m more than a little conflicted by it. \n On the one hand, I’ve been there: do I really need to take my iPhone along on this hike? I bought the Apple Watch with cellular capability precisely so that I would  not  need to take my phone everywhere. But, the question always surfaces, what if I want to take a quick picture to capture something amazing, beautiful, or cool? \nSo I usually end up bringing my phone along. \nOn the other hand, this is not exactly small and or unobtrusive. Wristcam adds a lot of bulk to your wrist, even though it’s only 23 grams light. If your wrist gets sore when you wear a smartwatch, this is the perfect 2020 accessory for you (as in: not good at all). \n And a smartwatch is already a downgrade, style-wise, from a stylish, chunky, analog timepiece you wear on your wrist. The extra bulk is not, shall we say, sexy. \n But the concept is cool. \n The Wristcam captures HD video and 4K still photos, and can be ordered in black (Noir) or white (Blanc) as well as gray, rose (you guessed it: pink), or Sage (Neanderthals like me might call that light green). One button on the Wristcam controls it, and an app for Apple Watch connects to it for your viewfinder, gallery, and (of course) sharing tools. There’s an internal battery which Wristcam characterizes as “all-day,” internal storage for your photos, and the device is water resistant: tested at meter or three feet for 30 minutes. \n I’m not sure if you’ll win any photography contests, but it is capable of some decent shots: \nHere’s another example the company provided: \nI haven’t personally tested it, but imagine mobile phone pictures circa about five years ago: could be pretty good if you have the right lighting, but don’t plan on zooming in very far or printing a poster. Video taken with the Wristcam is actually fairly good as well. \n This video, produced by Wristcam, illustrates how you might use a wrist-mounted watch: \nThe differently colored bands are interchangeable, so you can switch up your fashion statements without buying a whole new Wristcam, which will retail at $300, just in time for Christmas shopping. \nAccording to the company, Wristcam has been in development for five years. And, now that it’s here, it allows you to “break free from the screen and live in the moment while still capturing it.” \nThat’s a worthy endeavor. Whether the product holds up to the promise remains to be seen.  \n Follow me on Twitter or LinkedIn. Check out my website or some of my other work here.

    content:
      "   \nThose of you that were hoping for something new and exciting in iOS 14.3 Public Beta 3 had best look elsewhere. Apple's pushed their latest build out for Apple Beta Program participants and it's pretty much exactly the same as iOS 14.3 Public Beta 2. \nWhat New? \nThe biggest news in iOS 14.3 so far is the Shortcuts app changes. Clicking a customized icon, takes you right to the app and the Shortcuts app announces itself via a banner at the top of the screen (instead of opening Shortcuts like it does in iOS 14.2 and earlier). It's a much more elegant process and one that dedicated customizers will welcome. \nOther tidbits (culled from the initial beta release) include: \n\n\nApple ProRAW is now available for iPhone 12 Pro and Pro Max devices. \nAirTags and AirPods Studio references are still available if you know where to dig. \nThe Home app finally lets you update your HomeKit-enabled hardware without having to open the third-party app. \nEcosia, the eco-friendly search engine, is now an option in Safari \nIf you're also beta testing watchOS 7.2, you'll now see Cardio Fitness notifications that warn you when your cardio fitness drops low enough to adversely affect your VO2 max. \nApp Clips can now be launched by scanning a QR code with the camera. \nAir quality health recommendations are now offered for some regions including the US, UK, Germany, India, and Mexico. \nThird-party apps are now offered during setup in certain countries to comply with antitrust laws. \n\n\nWhat's Broken/What's Fixed? \nThere are a few things in the official release notes but much like last week, there's nothing there that's going to affect your workflow if you aren't a developer. \nThat doesn't mean there aren't bugs, however. If you encounter an app that is behaving strangely or an iOS process that isn't working the way you'd expect it to, report it via the Feedback app! \nWhat's Next? \niOS 14.3 Public Beta 3 is a great if you want to try out beta testing iOS. There are no listed issues and a couple of fun changes to test out. \nI don't expect iOS 14.3 to stay in beta for much longer. There are no real bugs to fix and its possible that this release could be setting the stage for the hardware release in December that Apple teased last month. For the oft-rumored Air Tags? The new ANC headphones? A few deeply hidden references seem to signal yes to both. \nIt could also be that Apple is holding iOS 14.3 until its new Fitness+ service is ready to launch. Teasers in the watchOS beta indicate that it will be supported by the next release and Apple did promise \"by the end of the year\" at the summer keynote. \nIf you're interested in getting started with beta testing, keep reading to see how! \nHow Do I Install The iOS 14.3 Beta? \nIf you're wondering how to get started, it's easy. Just go to the Apple Beta Program home page and sign in to the site above with the device you want to enroll in the beta. Go to the iOS 14 tab, then scroll down to Get Started and click the Enroll Your Device link. There you'll have the option to download the profile to your iPhone. Once you get the confirmation pop-up, head over to the Settings app. \nAt the top of the app, click the Profile Downloaded section at the top and verify that you want to install the profile. Then restart your iPhone when prompted. \nOnce you reboot, go to Settings &gt; General &gt; Software Update and download and install iOS 14.3!  \n Follow me on or LinkedIn. Check out my.

    content:
      "With almost no fanfare, Apple has quietly rolled out a new feature for the iPhone , and it’s one that everyone will have a chance to see. \nWith any update to iOS, Apple can add in new features as well as address bugs, fix problems, and increase security on the iPhone. The latest update to iOS 14.2 did just that with the changes announced in the release notes. But one feature did not appear in the notes. An improvement to the FaceTime selfie camera. \nPicked up by , Apple has increased the resolution of video from the forward facing camera for video calls to 1080p resolution on older iPhone models. (translated): \n\"Although the hardware of the front cameras of the iPhones 12 mini, 12, 12 Pro and 12 Pro is practically the same as the previous generation, Apple brought them a cool novelty: video calls via FaceTime in Full HD (1080p) resolution , both via Wi-Fi and via 5G. \n\"It would be a very typical software limitation from Apple, but this time it was cool and quietly released FaceTime HD (1080p) to all owners of iPhones 8 , 8 Plus , X , XR , XS , XS Max , SE of second generation , 11 , 11 Pro and 11 Pro Max.\" \nObviously the hardware has not changed, so the capability for 1080p has been secretly hiding in the handsets, only to be turned on now. This is not an unknown area for Apple; the iPod Touch originally shipped with bluetooth hardware , but it was not activated until a later software update ; and a number of Mac machines had 802.11n support switched on in 2007 ( through a $1.99 software download ). \nThe iPhone 12 family remains the only iPhone handsets that offer 1080p FaceTime while on a cellular network, but with this update handsets going back to the iPhone 8 will now be able to utilise the higher resolution over wi-fi. \nGiven the rise in ‘Work From Home’ and the use of video calls for business and personal use, the increase in resolution is welcomed. The question now is if the updates to the MacBook Air and MacBook Pro expected in 2021 will up the resolution of the FaceTime cameras on the laptops from the weaker 720p to match the iPhone. \n Now read the latest iPhone headlines in Forbes' weekly Apple Loop column... \n I am known for my strong views on mobile technology, online media, and the effect this has on the public conscious and existing businesses.\nI've been following this space for over ten years, working with a number of publishers, publications and media companies, some for long periods of time, others for commissions, one-off pieces or a series of articles or shows.\nAs Scotland’s first podcaster, I continue to be a prominent voice in the rise of podcasting and new media online, and picked up a British Academy (BAFTA) nomination for my annual coverage of the Edinburgh Festival Fringe, alongside contributions to Radio 5 Live, the BBC World Service, presenting Edinburgh local radio's coverage of the General Election.\n\nYou'll find me on Twitter ( @Ewan ), Facebook , and Google Plus.

      "Following Apple Award Win, Shanghai Developers Of Genshin Impact Hopes To Build Its Own ‘Marvel Universe’",

      "When Forrest Liu and his Shanghai-based video game developer company MiHoYo decided in 2017 to build a new mobile game to accompany its successful action RPG (role-playing game)  Honkai Impact series, he envisioned an open-world style adventure, in which users can roam freely with their virtual characters. \nThe problem was, while open-world games have been all the rage in the console and PC space, it had never been done before in the mobile gaming space. \n“It seemed like an impossible task,” Liu says. But after three years of development and “over 100 million yuan spent on the project,” the open-world mobile game Genshin Impact made its debut this past September. \nIt helped that MiHoYo, which was cofounded by Liu and two former college classmates in 2011, already had the smash hit Honkai series, so it wasn’t hard finding investors and resources to devote to Genshin Impact.  \nThe effort has paid off, because the game received 10 million downloads across iOS and Android platforms on just the first day, and it has since been released for consoles like the Sony Playstation 4 and Nintendo Switch. \nAnd today it was announced as the winner of the iPhone “Game of the Year” award from Apple as part of the U.S. tech giant’s “App Store Best Of 2020” awards. \nProudly flaunting the award—a thick blue block with Apple’s App Store logo on one end and MiHoYo’s name engraved on the other—over a Zoom call this morning, Liu and the company’s VP of overseas business Wenyi Jin shared their excitement at the news. \n“People thought we were crazy when we told them we were building an open-world game for smartphones,” recalls Liu, “but we knew that Apple’s mobile chip was powerful enough to handle the task.” \nWith aesthetics clearly inspired by Japanese anime, Genshin Impact is a free to download and play, but requires in-game purchases for players to “level up.” This has proved to be a lucrative business model for games, as the mobile game business has become a $50 billion industry. \n\nAlthough Liu and Jin declined to comment on revenue, a senior analyst at the research firm Niko Partners estimates Genshin has already generated 1 billion yuan ($152 million) in revenue from iOS and Android platforms alone. \nMiHoYo, in fact, picked up what was essentially the Android version of the “Best Game” award just a day before Apple’s announcement. But considering that iOS users on average spend 2.5x more money on apps than Android users, it’s safe to say the iOS success has been more lucrative. \nThe company isn’t done. Liu says the company was founded by “three fans of anime and [American] comic books,” and he sees MiHoYo as an IP (intellectual property) company rather than “just” a video game maker. \nTo that end, the company has its own animation and comic production house, as well as its own factory to manufacture merchandise. \n“We will continue to expand the Genshin universe by creating a line of comics, toys and maybe even a movie,” says Jin. \nLiu chimes in: “we want to create our own Marvel universe.” ",

    title: "Lenovo Flex 5G Review: A Swiss Army Laptop Ready For The Future",
    content:
      "   \n Lenovo's new Flex 5G is something of a contradiction. On one hand, it features what can only be considered bleeding edge technology—a 5G radio that lets you get your internet from a cellular network so new it's literally still being built. \nOn the other hand, the rest of the laptop is a fairly average 2-in-1 convertible, which is a laptop that lets you flip the screen all the way around to the back and use like a tablet. If only Lenovo had recognized the uniqueness of its laptop and gone all-in for the bleeding edge. \n\nThe Lenovo Flex 5G In a Nutshell \nPros: \n\n\n5G connectivity \nTwo-day battery life \nHighly portable design \n\n\nCons: \n\n\nCompatibility issues \nLimited 5G networks \nMundane design and performance \n\n\nRating: 3 out of 5 \nLenovo Flex 5G Technical Specifications \nPrice: $1,400 | CPU: Qualcomm Snapdragon 8cx | OS: Windows 10 Pro 64 | Display: 14-inch, 1920 x 1080 pixels, touchscreen, 400 nits | Memory: 8GB LPDDR4X | Storage: 256 GB UFS 3.0 | Battery life: Up to 24 hours | Weight: 2.9 pounds \nThe Flex is 5G-Ready \nOne can't help but start with what makes the Flex 5G remarkable: It includes a Qualcomm X55 modem that lets the laptop connect to both Verizon's LTE and 5G networks when there’s no Wi-Fi available. This is the first laptop to include 5G connectivity, and that’s pretty remarkable; if you're in a coverage area, you have a theoretical max download speed of about 10Gbps. \nThe devil's in the details, however; 5G connectivity is still pretty limited. Here in the greater LA area, I'd need to drive a half hour to find some of Verizon’s high-speed ultra-wideband 5G coverage. But the laptop works just great with 4G LTE too, though, and on a recent trip where I regularly switched between Wi-Fi and cellular at various destinations, it never skipped a beat. \nMy actual internet performance? Usually about 30 Mbps, which is underwhelming if you're expecting 5G speeds, but on par with what my iPhone pulls down in LTE mode. It's not the laptop's fault; it's simply a year or so too soon for 5G in most locales. But if you do happen to live in or travel to 5G coverage areas, your cellular speeds may blow you away. \nLenovo Flex 5G Design \nThe modem might be the star attraction, but the Flex 5G is otherwise a fairly typical 2-in-1 convertible. Some people might find the understated aluminum and magnesium chassis to be a bit bland, but I really liked the restrained aesthetics; it has simple lines and such a clean, smooth, utterly featureless body that it almost looks like an early prototype. There's barely any branding, save for a small Lenovo logo—almost resembling a tag on a pair of blue jeans—on the right side of both the lid and deck. There's a third logo on the front lip of the lid, but it's so subtle it's almost an Easter egg. The laptop is pretty small at 12.7 x 8.4 x 0.6 inches and weighs in at about 2.9 pounds — for comparison, think MacBook Air. \nThe backlit keyboard is comfortable and the deck feels solid, with essentially no flex (and I tend to bang on the keys pretty hard). The touchpad is large and centered, and it easily recognized every swipe, click, and gesture. \nOpen the screen past 180 degrees and Windows thoughtfully asks if you want to switch to tablet mode. The Flex works both tented (handy for presentations or watching movies) and as a full-on tablet, and the display was responsive and accurate when I controlled it with my fingers. \nDespite having a relatively narrow bezel all around, Lenovo manages to pack a Windows Hello-compatible 720p camera into the top. The camera lives in a very subtle notch that interrupts the slope of the lid, but doesn’t actually change its shape. If you didn't know this was where the camera was hidden, you'd think it was a design element for the aforementioned Lenovo logo. \nThe upshot of all this is that you get a face recognition camera for logging into Windows, or if you prefer, you can use the fingerprint reader on the right side of the deck. As a webcam, the camera is perfectly adequate, but you'd be forgiven for adding an external webcam if you spend a lot of time in Zoom calls. \nOne of the design decisions that helps the Flex look clean and polished is the lack of ports cluttering up the sides. The industry trend these days is toward laptops with fewer ports, and the Flex 5G has just two: A pair of USB-C ports, one of which doubles as the charging port. That's all you'll find on the left; the right has a power button, headphone jack and a slider to activate Airplane Mode, which disables both Wi-Fi and the cellular radio. \nLenovo Flex 5G Performance and Compatibility \nAs I mentioned at the outset, all this is about average for a 2-in-1. Unfortunately, the system has one Achilles’ Heel—its Qualcomm Snapdragon 8cx, an ARM-based chipset packing a CPU, GPU and data radios. Using an ARM processor rather than an Intel Core processor has benefits, but software compatibility isn't one of them. This is a situation in which your mileage will definitely vary. Some users will never encounter a problem installing and using software, ever. But most users, no doubt, will hit the occasional, frustrating snag. \nOn my second day with the laptop, for example, I tried setting up Dropbox and discovered that the standard app isn't compatible. Instead, Dropbox recommended installing Dropbox for S, which is a feature-limited version of the app designed for tablets running in Windows 10 S Mode. \nHow serious is this problem? Well, Snapdragon is designed to run ARM-optimized apps (of which there are many), as well as 32-bit apps x86 through an ARM emulator (which can affect performance, though generally not by much). But ARM can't run 64-bit x86 apps at all, which is what prevented me from installing Dropbox. Likewise, I could only get the 32-bit version of Photoshop, and this isn't much of a gaming system; between 64-bit-only games and somewhat slower emulation mode for everything else, gamers will want to invest in a laptop running an Intel Core or AMD Ryzen processor. \nCompatibility issues aside, performance was adequate for the day-to-day tasks I needed to accomplish in Outlook, Word, Excel, and so on. Things began to crawl when I opened a large number of tabs in Chrome. Overall, it was fine, but I couldn’t help but think about the fact that a much cheaper 2-in-1, like the Intel Core-equipped HP Pavilion, runs circles around the Flex 5G. \nThe 14-inch display has a full HD resolution (1920 x 1080 pixels) and is quite bright for a laptops—it runs about 400 nits—but it was easily overwhelmed by sunlight. Don't plan to use the Flex outdoors much. \nLenovo Flex 5G Battery Life \nRemember when I mentioned that using an ARM processor has its benefits? Atop that list is battery life. In my informal testing, the Flex ran for an impressive 19 hours, which is the longest battery life of any laptop I’ve ever used. \nThat’s not just an all-day battery—that’s a two-day battery. On a cross-country trip, I charged the Flex the night before and used it all day long, including leaning heavily on the cellular connection for internet service at the airports. I continued using it that evening and well into the next day before I even thought about charging it. When I eventually plugged the AC adapter into the USB-C port, it still had almost half the battery life remaining. You won’t often encounter that sort of freedom from tyrannical AC adapters. \nFinal Word on the Lenovo Flex 5G \nBefore long, there will be a handful of 5G-equipped laptops to choose from, but for the moment, Lenovo's Flex 5G stands alone. Combine that with an incredible two-day battery life, and this should, in principle, be a formidable portable. \nBut the rest of the package is just so-so, especially considering the heart-stopping $1,400 price tag. The Snapdragon processor's okay performance and compatibility issues might give you pause, and the overall design is competent, not superlative. If the small form factor, tight aluminum construction, long battery life and first-out-of-the-gate 5G appeals to you, it can be yours for $1,400. But given the price and processor issues, I'd be inclined to wait a while and see what the competition has to offer. ",

      "Walrus Knows The World Hates 99% Of Advertising. It Aims To Be The 1%",
    content:
      "New York agency Walrus sprung to life 15 years ago. In 2005, Frances Webster and colleague and spouse Deacon Webster had learned that the agency they were working for, Mad Dogs and Englishman, would close. (It has since reopened.) That was a Friday and the following Monday, the two opened Walrus with a bunch of account people and five accounts. \nThe intervening decade and a half were a time of rapid change for the industry. “It's just so much faster and so much cheaper,” said Webster. “I mean, people are shooting movies now on iPhones, you know,  good  ones. Yeah. Back then, back then there wasn't even an iPhone.” \nWebster said the rapid digitization of media has had little effect on the role of advertising, which he said is still viewed as interruptive. Still, there is a small portion of advertising that people like and the agency’s mission is to make more of that kind of advertising. \nExamples from the agency include ads for stool softener Colace that are designed to run as people are waiting for their videos to load and Feats of Middle Age, a campaign for magnesium brand Slow-Mag MG that features accomplishments like Getting Out of the Pool Without Using the Ladder rendered in comic-book style. \nAs Webster explains, changing how the world feels about advertising is a lofty goal, but “we've tried to put that lens over all the work that we make,” he said. “Would we be ashamed if our friends saw it? Or would they like us for it and want to tell their friends that this is what we do?” \nThe combination of a real-life perspective on how the work is perceived along with the ability to make funny ads is a hallmark of Walrus’ work. “The key is just putting the audience first,” said Frances Webster, the agency’s cofounder. At the same time, Walrus is cognizant that the messaging has to work for clients. \n “ I think it's no surprise that the world hates advertising 99 percent of the time—it interrupts their web search experience and gets in the way of their shows, and it kind of yells at them. But there is a small portion of it out there that people actually like,” said Webster. “So we want to make more of that. ”  \n I am a veteran ad industry journalist with a fondness for tech. I have also witnessed first-hand the sweeping changes in the media landscape over the past two or three decades. I was the final editor of Adweek’s Brandweek and was the founding business editor of Mashable. My work has appeared in The New York Times, The Washington Post, The Economist and elsewhere. My interests include technology, marketing, media and dogs. My favorite movie about the advertising business is How to Get Ahead in Advertising and my favorite TV show about it is, of course, MadMen. I live in New Jersey. You can reach me at toddwasserman@gmail.com. ",

    "If These Apps Are Installed On Your Phone, You Can ‘Easily’ Be Hacked",
  content:
    "When iPhone users claim their devices are more secure than Android alternatives, it’s security reports such as the latest from Check Point they have in mind. The cyber firm has suddenly warned that “countless Android apps” are vulnerable to a security threat that should have been patched six months ago, “jeopardizing hundreds of millions of users.” These are apps almost guaranteed to be on your phone right now. \n Yet again the issue relates to a software library buried within multiple apps—ironically, though, this library was developed by Google itself as a shortcut for apps to interface with its Play Store. The “ highly dangerous ” was reported in detail back in August—a vulnerability in thousands of apps that would enable hackers to “steal users’ login details, passwords, and financial details, and read their mail.” \n Such an attack requires fairly simple malware to be planted on your phone—think of all those rogue email attachments, texted links or viral images. That malware then attacks one of the popular apps carrying the vulnerability, piggybacking on that genuine app’s permissions to access data on your phone. As such, the new malware doesn’t need to ask you for new permissions, risking detection. \nAccording to Check Point researcher Aviran Hazum, the threat is “very serious and easy to exploit.” It hasn’t been caught in the wild as yet, but given this latest publicity, attackers will now be aware of the problem which makes it much worse. A proof of concept, which attacked Google Chrome before it was patched, “used a Dropbox cookie (stored within Google Chrome) to steal files from the cloud storage platform.” \nGoogle patched the flaw in its Play Core Library way back in April, but a huge number of apps have not bothered to update the library within their own software. “During the month of September,” Check Point says, “13% of Google Play applications we analyzed used this library, and 8% of those apps had a vulnerable version.” \nSo, should users be worried? Yes, according to Hazum. “Users should  be worried about the data stored inside or accessible to applications. The malicious payload will have the same access as the hosting application. For example, injecting code into a messenger to steal all messages, or send messages on the user’s behalf. Or if a banking app is vulnerable, the attacker can steal credentials and even 2FA codes.” \nCheck Point also warns that the vulnerability can be used to “inject code into enterprise applications to gain access to corporate resources or into social media applications to spy on the victim and use location access to track the device.” As ever, a vulnerability with a popular app installed on tens of millions of devices provides a large attack surface for a targeted campaign. This becomes a soft entry point to steal credentials for a corporate network, for example, or to track persons of interest. \nIf you need convincing as to the severity of this, then let’s look at some of the apps that have just recently patched this vulnerability. \nBooking.com told me “we can confirm we have already addressed this vulnerability with a patch to our Android app on November 11.” And Cisco confirmed that “on December 1, [we] published software updates for the Cisco WebEx Teams mobile app for Android that include fixed versions of the Google Play Core Library that contains the security vulnerability.” \nGrindr told me that “we are grateful for the Check Point researcher who brought the vulnerability to our attention today. Our team quickly responded, and we have already issued a hotfix… We will continue to enhance our practices to proactively address these and similar concerns as we continue our commitment to our users.” And OkCupid confirmed “we were notified by Check Point earlier this week and have already released the fix. We’re grateful to partners like Check Point who together with OkCupid, put the safety and privacy of our users first.” \nThe issue is widespread. Check Point also lists Viber, Yango Pro and even Microsoft Edge among those apps it tested and says it found to be vulnerable, none of which responded to requests for comment before publishing. Moovit, which was also named, confirmed after publication that it had issued a fix. But to single any out would be misleading—these are just the ones Check Point “randomly” happened to test and name. One can assume those apps have patched or will soon patch the problem—it just requires the updated Google library. It’s the “countless” other apps that haven’t been tested by Check Point and so haven’t been notified that is the real issue here. \nOn one level, Google can’t do much about this. It’s for developers to manage the security of their apps. But, in truth, Google could  mandate the fix and test apps in its Play Store to ensure they are running the updated library. But Android is much more fragmented and less well policed than iOS—that’s why those iPhone users feel better protected. As Forbes  cybersecurity contributor Davey Winder said on his move from Android to iPhone , “four words explain it—security, privacy, fractured, ecosystem… I've been growing increasingly unhappy when it comes to security updates.” \nThe unhappy  situation here is that those “hundreds of millions” of users can’t know which apps have been patched and which have not. And so advising users to update or delete apps is impossible. Instead, the only advice is to be very careful with the apps you install on your phone to avoid the risk that of allowing malware onto the phone that can target the permissions given to a popular app to steal your data. \nThat means no third-party app stores, no clicking indiscriminately on emailed or texted links, no saving  images or videos onto your phone from social media sites or messengers unless  you can be fairly sure that they were created  by a trusted sender. You can also look to install an antivirus program onto your device, albeit make sure it’s from a reputable developer if you do, and that means a mainstream, paid for app. ",
